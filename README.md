# TSLox
A Typescript implementation of the [Lox programming language](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html)

## What?

This is me following Bob Nystrom´s [Crafting interpreters](http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/) tutorial.

I´ve been wanting to do it for a bit, and I recently started using Typescript (even vainilla JS is new to me) at work and I think I can kill two birds with one stone if I do this tutorial with typescript.
